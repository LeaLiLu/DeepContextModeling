1	basically it looks like your file-system has become corrupted then thankfully however your __path__ directory has remained in-tact you can run some disk checks on your hard disk to see if you can recover errors if you wish or reinstall ubuntu keeping most of your settings and all of your __path__ folder files in tact	so how can i retain my files and get everything alright	fsck -pf __path__ try that first though	actually sudo fsck -pv __path__	sorry i mean sudo fsck -pf __path__	hmm this means that ubuntu will need a reinstall from the livecd can you go through the steps of the install until the stage where you choose where you want to install ubuntu and then message me again since then we can preserve your user settings and files	because the partition __path__ is intact and that is where you have kept your files the file system at __path__ is your ubuntu partition where the operating system is installed to ubuntu checks __path__ on your system to find your files and settings	i ll explain what to do when you get to the stage in the installer where you have to choose where ubuntu is installed i hope that i can better sense of it to you there	sda5 is where your home folder/directory is kept on the system that you setup so luckily that wo n't be erased	when it asks you where in the installer where you d like to install click on advanced setup and i ll talk you through the steps	the correct option should be titled specify partitions manually or something similar	okay good right click on sda5 what are the options called ( sorry i m not in the installer atm so i ca n't remember the exact names )	click change then next to mount point set it to __path__ and then make sure that the format the partition box is not ticked	then do change on sda6 make sure that it is ext4 that for the format box is ticked and that the mount point is __path__	sorry for sda6 the mount point is __path__ not __path__	well ext4 is a preference for me but you can use ext3 too	for sda5 change the mount point to __path__ and make sure the formatting box is not ticked for sda6 make sure the mount point is __path__ and that the formatting box is ticked	when you re happy click forward and finish the install	try to make sure that you use the same username as last time and preferrably same password so it keeps your user settings	same password is n't required but it helps with wireless keyrings enjoy

1	ok im back	any ideas on how to trouble shoot this	ok did you download all the stuff from the readme and install it	alnost	i think you also need to install libhid0	synaptic does n't find libswig .. is that important	maybe i do n't know	if stuff does n't work you will have to compile it yourself and install it	you there	yes still trying to figure this out still no ideas	well after reading the documentation it should of worked without all these extra stuff with hiddev somehow your device is not being recognized	um are you using the 1208ls	the 1208fs it works in windows with the manufacturers software i just tried it	could it be that the test program is looking in the wrong place maybe ubuntu puts the usb devices somewhere else ?? ( i m only testing it with the test-usb1208fs program )	are you still there	well i am totally at a loss and i do n't know if i can do anything more without actually having your device as with most things with linux either it works or it does n't and if it does n't it could but can be very hard to get to work i think your device might actually be blacklisted in the hid-core stuff but i ca n't find it	do you think this is an issue __number__ need to be root or have the program run suid unless one configures with __path__ file with hotplug ."	when you plug in the device it should be recognized correctly and not as an xpad so if dmesg is not saying it is there it is n't there to use	but __path__ shows it __url__	its showing an xpad connecting if you rmmod the xpad you still wo n't have the correct driver loaded to use your device when you connect it should load the right driver

0	keen eye :)	same type in line __number__ then	typo*	i need script to search on html file and find urls with mp4 in the end and insert it into textlist	that s beyond me	ok then the only thing i ( personnaly ) can suggest at thispoint it to check your spelling in that command or ask again periodicaly for someone else to helpyou it would help you to state the specific problem when you ask ie the modprobe issue look it up in synaptic always the best place but it might not be in the repos you might hve to dl it

1	pelo yes with my fans working that s what i m seeing	mmm ... well if the only difference is the os then you re looking at cpu scaling - or cpu usage is this while in use or at idle	while in use ... if it s idle i can maybe get it to 60c ... only when i first turn on the laptop will it be at 55c	or i suppose it s possible that the fan runs at a more consistent higher speed in windows i ve seen some machines run warmer in linux at idle because well the screensavers are so much more ... intense	i do n't know how much faster these fans can run they re already pretty loud and fast at 2200rpm and 1800rpm	are the temperatures you re mentioning now in windows and you said __number__ in linux right	these temperatures are in linux	and what were the temps in windows	i do n't have reference temperatures for windows ... this was a friend s laptop that she gave to me and she told me that it was never this hot .... like it s very hot to the touch on the bottom	mmm ... well if you have the fans maxed out and you re using cpu scaling you might want to make sure it s not a change in the hardware that coincides with the change of os	it s bad when you spend a week trying to troubleshoot a software problem that turns out to be hardware	is it possible for you to image the drive install windows and see if the temps change	yeah probably but i ll have to do it in about a week i have exams right now	sorry i ca n't think of much else to try until you know for sure you re trying to fix a completely subjective problem based on user info	and 55-60 is not that hot at all __number__ under load not bad either	qwell [] i m talking about __number__ degrees celsius i m canadian that s how we roll here .. metric stylez	sorry i was thinking in farenheit what processor	although according to intel you re operating at normal temperatures	but ... it ca n't hurt to use arctic silver i have a teeny tube right here i hate those sticky pads	yeah i know this old line of p4s relaly had high temps qwell [] aiight thanks for your help with that now i have a course of action that i can take

1	hi all quick question about upgrading to feisty	i mean that seems a little high	is there some way to do the upgrade without consuming that much space in __path__	when i run update-manager -c -d the process errors out ( supposedly ) because of insufficient disk space on __path__ -- it requires __number__ mb but i ve sized it to only be ~22m ( this machine was previously a gentoo install where i had more control over what went in it )	you should be able to create some space by moving something within __path__ to another partition and leaving a symlink behind -- something like ln -s __path__ __path__	or remove __path__ from __path__ and point it to another location	well thing i m worried about is that the total size of __path__ is smaller than what this thing needs	and then ( say ) manually merge the real __path__ and the fake __path__ after update-manager is done hmm

1	flash has no sound in chromium-browser ideas hos to fix this issue	32bit or 64bit	32bit	just look in the partner repo and install or download he deb from adobe website	everything works just fine video and so on but there is no sound	might need ubuntu-restricted-extras maybe	audio works in other apps i assume	yep flash in ff works just fine	wow that is strange	you running chrome or chromium chromium-brwoser

1	fuck how would i know when it disappear what if it disappears i make a bunch of backups then i notice it s not in the backups anymore	how ??	no ... not like that ... i ve never had data dissappear from my db ... i ve had a bunch of data get inserted and it dissapears before it ever gets written to disc it does n't happen very often ( probably 2x in __number__ years ) but when it does it just looks like the insert failed	okay cool	will remind me when i m writing software for it make damn sure insert works before i get rid of data i created for it prolly a good idea in general anyway	mysql is fine for most home databases ... and slashdot.org uses it so it can scale well ... it s just not what i would call mission critical yet ... i use it for my website though without issue	that s always a good idea ...	__url__ if you want to see a simple site that uses it	what u think is best database client to do queries and such available ( for free ) on linux	i checked out the new ooo database application in ooo __number__ thought it sucked looked incomplete may be better later like next year	for mysql mysqlcc is the best for me ... but i find if i m going to be doing anything complicated i just do it myself in python	would be nice if it can connect to any db including commercial ones	any good ones that connect to multiple db commercial server or otherwise	that i do n't know ... every commercial server i ve used has always come with it s own front end ... of course my knowledge of commercial databases is limited to oracle sql server and informix	exactly that s the diff between the two	makes me feel better about your db recommendations	i d also suggest learning python and how to pass queries to mysql through it ... it s how i do alot of remote maitenance	yeah lots in common in our computer geek choices i just wrote a __number__ line python script to download all my favorite npr programs via cron every day	never used it to talk to a database though	i ve got python scripts on cron that do alot to my database ... for instance i have a list of every cd i own on my database but i do n't want to manually insert them so a python script queries my ripped cd s nightly and if it finds one that is n't online it inserts it what was your website think i am gonna check it out
