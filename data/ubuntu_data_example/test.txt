1	hi i have a question does ramdisk mean that i mount a partition to my ram	- you probably do n't want to try to outsmart the os and how it uses ram ;)	what i mean is that sometimes some applications or programs take a lot of time loading and swapping from disk if i put that program/application on ramdisk it should load much faster since everything is one ram right	- no	why	- if swap is happening taking away ram is going to cause more swapping what if i have enough ram to make swap partition on ram as well
